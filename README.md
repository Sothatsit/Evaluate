About
-----
A library to efficiently parse, optimise and evaluate string expressions.

**Note:** The optimisation steps of this library do not ensure complete floating 
point equivalence between the original and optimised expressions, as
the order of evaluation is not maintained.

TODO
----
Compilation of expressions into java bytecode for use at runtime.
